        Julius Caesar Essay: Julius Caesar was Roman General and statesman who is widely known for his notable role in the events which led to the fall of the Roman Empire. He was a celebrated politician and can also be termed as a successful one. His most outstanding achievement was the invasion of Britain. However, Caesar’s acts were almost always against the decisions of the Senate, and despite his crucial successes, he was soon requested to step down.
Caesar, driven with political and military authority, disregarded the Senate every time. The elites soon were discontented towards his social reforms. Caesar was finally assassinated by a group of senators. The most crucial literary representation of Caesar was in the play called “Julius Caesar” by William Shakespeare.
