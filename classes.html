            The .class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.

            To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.
            
            You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class. To do this, start with the element name, then write the period (.) character, followed by the name of the class (look at Example 1 below).
            
            HTML elements can also refer to more than one class (look at Example 2 below).
