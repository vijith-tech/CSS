         reported in a day, while the recoveries have crossed 2.94 crores, according to the Union Health Ministry 
         data updated on Wednesday. The death count increased to 3,98,454 with 817 new fatalities, the data updated 
         at 8 am showed. Meanwhile, IndiaCovaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the
          Indian Council of Medical Research, effectively neutralises both Alpha and Delta variants of coronavirus,
           the US' National Institute of Health has said. The NIH said results of two studies of blood serum from
            people who had received Covaxin suggest that the vaccine generates antibodies that effectively 
            neutralise the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.617 (Delta) variants of SARS-CoV-2, first identified in the
             UK and India, respectively. The top American health research institute, which has a history of
              strong scientific collaboration with India, also said that an adjuvant developed with funding 
              from it has contributed to the success of the highly efficacious Covaxin, which has been 
              administered to roughly 25 million people till date in India and elsewhere. New Delhi:
