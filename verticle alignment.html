The word leading derives from lead strips that were put between set lines of metal type to increase the line spacing of a text block. That’s also why it is pronounced “ledding” and not “leeding”. The spacing between individual elements of a website and, in particular, the vertical spacing, has been a regular matter of debate between web designers and developers. Designers insist that what they see in the browser doesn’t look at all like the layout they originally designed. Developers respond that all the margins in the style sheets exactly match the margins in the layout. So who is right? The tricky thing is: In a way, they are both right.Let’s take this simple example of three text blocks underneath each other: No. Instead, the problem which – at least in my experience – many designers and developers still don’t know about, results from a difference in how many design tools and web browsers handle line-height or, to be more precise, leading.In typography, leading is a measure for the space between adjacent lines of text.
